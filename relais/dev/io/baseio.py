				The output (or input) for the object, being a file path or an open

			mode
				What mode to open any file path as, if necessary. If an open
				file-like is supplied, obviously this won't be used. By default,
				it is set to 'rb', the least destructive option. Derived classes

			fmt
				The file format. This is case-insensitive and if not given is
				derived from the handles ``name`` attribute. Obviously, it's
